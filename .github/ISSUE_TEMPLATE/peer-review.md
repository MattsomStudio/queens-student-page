### 1) Functionality
- [x] Page loads; links & images work.  
Everything works correctly.

### 2) Clarity / Content
- [x] Clear headings; intro explains who/what.  
Headings and intro are clear.

### 3) Accessibility
- [x] All images have alt text; heading levels are logical.  
Alt text is present but could be more descriptive.

### 4) Style / CSS
- [x] Consistent colors; styles in style.css.  
CSS is linked correctly.

### 5) Performance
- [x] Images are not huge; widths/heights set.  
Image sizing is appropriate.

### 6) Documentation
- [ ] README tells how to update; commit messages are descriptive.  
The README could explain how to deploy or update the page.

### 7) Concrete Suggestion (include code if helpful)
Add a short description under your “Projects” list so it feels less placeholder-like. Example:  
```html
<li>Project Two — A placeholder for his upcoming work in web development.</li>
